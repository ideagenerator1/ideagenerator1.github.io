			<h1>In Defense of Conspiracy Theorizing</h1>
				<div>
				<p style="margin-top: 13px;">A conspiracy is a hidden or concealed plan to bring about some ends among any number of individuals. A theory is a hypothesis that attempts to explain a given set of observations. Therefore, a conspiracy theory can reasonably considered to be a hypothesis regarding observations of the world or world events that invokes conspiracy.</p>
				<p>Before going any further, it should be noted that many so-called “conspiracies”, such as the movement in favor of a one world polity (sometimes called ‘world federalism’), are only partially hidden or concealed. They are often acknowledged rather openly in certain contexts, but are systematically shielded from public exposure. In addition, many purported “conspiracy theories”, such as (but certainly not limited to) MK-ULTRA, Operation Northwoods and mass domestic electronic surveillance are so well-documented as to effectively be historical events. Therefore, these shouldn’t be considered ‘conspiracy theories’ in a strict sense.</p>
				<p>However, in practice, the term ‘conspiracy theory’ is simply a pejorative intended to preemptively disqualify statements or hypotheses regarding events that users of the term are biased against for whatever reason. It is not a meaningful or useful category in any way whatsoever. Insofar as it is a useful category, it is applied selectively by anti-conspiracists to attack ideas they don’t like.</p>
				<p>While most critics of the conspiratorial worldview tend to inveigh against it through sneering ridicule or the psychologization of those who subscribe to the view (for example, when counter-conspiracists claim that anyone who questions mainstream narratives is “seeking out patterns where there are none”, or some such other pompous insinuation), some attempt more serious arguments against the idea of conspiracy in general. The latter tend to deploy one or both of the following as centerpoints in their argument:</p>
				<br>
				<p>a) Ockham’s Razor/Principle of Parsimony;
				<br>
				b) the ‘unstable’ nature of conspiracies/secret plots;</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Ockham's Razor:</h4>
				<br>
				<p>Ockham’s Razor (also known as the Principle or Law of Parsimony), named after English Franciscan scholastic philosopher and theologian William of Ockham, was developed in the context of William of Ockham’s arguments in favor of philosophical nominalism, and generally finds its greatest applicability in the hard sciences and statistical modeling. It is often said that Ockham’s Razor is the principle that the simplest (or most parsimonious) explanation is generally the correct one. While not technically incorrect, this simplified definition is misleading in that it does not sufficiently unpack what ‘simple’ and ‘explanation’ mean in this context.</p>
				<p>More precisely, Ockham’s Razor is the principle that, given a set of observations or data, the hypothesis that explains or accounts for all of the observations/data while invoking the least amount of assumptions (i.e., incorporating the smallest number of parameters) is the most likely hypothesis to be true, or is likely the most accurate hypothesis/model.</p>
				<p>Ockham's Razor is essentially a heuristic used to circumscribe hypotheses to what is testable or falsifiable as opposed to overly complex. Despite Ockham’s Razor’s usefulness in science and modeling, its applicability to the analysis of world events is frankly rather limited, and its usage by critics of “conspiracy theories” is almost universally flawed. This is because most “conspiracy theories” arise precisely because ‘official’ or mainstream hypotheses about world events (which themselves can often be considered ‘conspiracy theories’, if we are to accept that terminology) <u>cannot explain all observations</u> regarding said events, and therefore must be false. It does not matter how simple, parsimonious or elegant a hypothesis or theory is; if it cannot account for all the observations it attempts to explain, it cannot be true.</p>
				<p>In fact, most “conspiracy theories” are not really proper hypotheses or theories. They can most accurately be characterized as statements/propositions (i.e., statements of the ‘if P, then Q’ or ‘P therefore Q’ form), which the Razor cannot be applied to. Take the classic example of 9/11 – when so-called ‘conspiracy theorists’ mention that several large explosions appear to have occurred before the planes impacted the towers, that exotic incendiary energetic materials were found to be in the World Trade Center dust or that the supposed 9/11 hijackers’ were intimately associated with certain intelligence agencies, they are implying a statement such as the following: explosions occurred right before the attacks, cutting edge highly engineered incendiary materials available only to a select few governments/militaries around the world were found in the World Trade Center rubble, and the 9/11 hijackers were deeply involved with certain intelligence agencies and governments, therefore the ‘official story’ cannot be true, or at the very least is extremely unlikely to be true.</p>
				<p>Obviously, the aforementioned claims affirmed by conspiracy theorists contradict or make incredibly unlikely the ‘official story’, which is that nineteen Middle Eastern hijackers associated with the ostensible radical Wahhabist terrorist organization ‘Al-Qaeda’ acted alone (though some versions of the official story allow for some minor or indirect involvement of the government of Saudi Arabia) to fly airliners into the Twin Towers, Pentagon and White House, and that the Twin Towers collapsed exclusively as a result of plane impact.</p>
				<p>Statements and the analytic propositions/logic and factual claims embedded in such are obviously not necessarily true and must be evaluated. But when “conspiracy theorists” merely question or interrogate official narratives surrounding events, point out obvious anomalies or eliminate any ‘non-conspiratorial’ or ‘mainstream’ explanation for events through contradiction, it is incorrect to simply put forth Ockham’s Razor as some clever universal refutation of conspiratorial thinking, since the Razor applies to <u>competing valid hypotheses</u>, not statements/propositions, and especially not statements/propositions intending to show that ‘official’ or non-conspiratorial hypotheses are not valid.</p>
				<p>Now, if a conspiracist were to make a specific claim that attempts to explain a given event (e.g., ), this could be considered a hypothesis or ‘conspiracy theory’. At this point, the conspiracist is entering the realm of suppostion and hypothesis, and the Razor may assume some limited degree of usefulness in evaluating competing valid theories that can’t be stricly ‘proven’. However, this does not imply that the non-conspiratorial or mainstream explanation must be true because it is “simpler” (and, it often isn’t even the case that the official explanation is simpler). Regardless of how simple it is, if it cannot explain the observations and is contradicted by facts, it cannot be true.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Unstable Conspiracies:</h4>
				<br>
				<p>Many make the claim that sucessful and long-running conspiracies are very unlikely because they are an unstable equilibrium. The argument usually goes something like this: conspiracies, which rely for their functioning on their participants cooperating, are almost guaranteed to fall apart shortly after being established because there is an incentive for participants in the conspiracy or plot to ‘cheat’ by betraying the other conspirators through any number of means, be it through selling the plot out to others, revealing it to the “authorities” in order to broker more favorable prosection deals, or in some other way not cooperating with other plotters. An additional aspect of this is that conspiracies are likely to leak just by accident or through negligence, since people are naturally bad at keeping secrets. Clearly, in this analysis, as the number of conspirators increases, the more likely it is that the conspiracy will be leaked and consequently exposed and unraveled.</p>
				<p>This attempted gamification and reduction of a complex social phenomenon is rather simplistic and makes a slew of dubious assumptions:</p>
				<p>a) That all participants in the conspiracy know everything about the conspiracy, including its ultimate goal and all the details of its operation. This is clearly an absurd assumption. It would be very difficult for anyone to provide an example of any serious organization, formal or otherwise, that doesn’t operate on the principle of compartmentalization of information (i.e., on a “need to know basis”) precisely because of the threat of leaks. Just because someone is a member of an intelligence agency/military/govermment, corporation/private entity, criminal organization or broad transinstitutional conspiracy does not mean they know what is going on or even who is involved at all in other parts. In this way, even if certain components or aspects of a plot are exposed (usually accidentally or from without), the entire conspiracy is not elucidated and does not unravel.</p>
				<p>b) That there are external bodies that the conspirators are in some way accountable to. And, if such bodies exist, that they are not in some way or another complicit in or co-opted, controlled, or in some other way subsumed by the conspiracy.</p>
				<p>c) That there are no costs for ‘cheaters’ who betray the conspiracy. This is obviously not the case. It is simply a matter of routine for credible threats to be employed against those who betray or give away information. For example, those involved in intelligence agencies, the military and other government bodies face prosecution and potentially more extreme threats if they reveal anything about their work. It is also fairly routine for participants in conspiracies to be mutually blackmailed such that if they were to betray the plot, they would be individually damaged.</p>
				<p>d) That participants in conspiracies are exclusively self-interested and that their participation is not informed by political, religious/ideological, or group dynamical (be it racial/ethnic, class, national, etc.) factors that might override or complicate their individual self-interest. In this way, it reifies methodological individualism in an unrealistic and not particularly useful way.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
				<br>
				<p>So, neither Ockham’s Razor nor the idea that conspiracies are necessarily unstable can be applied reliably to address conspiratorial claims. In fact, if they were applied consistently by those who forward them as arguments against conspiracy in this hyper-skeptical manner, then people would have an extremely difficult time explaining the world in any way or even navigating daily life.</p>
				<p>The reality is that societies in a very real sense operate on the basis of conspiracy, and it is perfectly reasonable and rational for people to hypothesize about “conspiracies”. If conspiracies are so unlikely, how then is the existence and demonstrable effectiveness of intelligence agencies, political organizations, governments, corporations, criminal organizations, or even ordinary factions of people, etc. explainable at all? The aforementioned are, after all, bodies of individuals collaborating to bring about plans that are concealed from outsiders to varying degrees.</p>
				<p>In order for people to make sense of the world at large, they must engage essentially in what “conspiracy theorists” do – eliminate certain explanations for given events through contradiction, and at least attempt to arrive at a more accurate and complete understanding of things through reasoned hypothesis, surmise and conjecture (i.e., making “extraordinary claims”). And, people who categorically reject conspiratorial thinking for political, ideological or cultural reasons, do the same exact things conspiracy theorists do every single day when they are trying to explain the world, whether they realize it or not.</p>
