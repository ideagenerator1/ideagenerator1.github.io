			<h1>In-Depth: How Israel Created the European Refugee Crisis</h1>

				<h3 style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px;"><b><a href="https://nationaljusticeparty.com/2021/05/20/in-depth-how-israel-created-the-european-refugee-crisis/">Via National Justice Party</a></b></h3>
				<p style="margin-top: 13px;">The world has looked on with shock and horror at the Jewish bombardment of innocent civilians in Palestine over the last few days. Apparently even Israel thinks their actions are indefensible, since on May 15th, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) destroyed a building housing the Associated Press (AP) and other media outlets in Gaza with the intention of stopping images of Palestinian suffering from reaching the rest of the world. Following the attack on the AP, Israel stepped up its bombing of civilian targets, killing dozens of Palestinians with airstrikes on populated streets.</p>
				<p>But the Zionist strategy entails more than simply brutally punishing Palestinians and other Arab populations that stand up to them. They also utilize an extensive network of Jewish-run NGOs and refugee resettlement agencies in the West to empty the Middle-East of potential opponents.</p>
				<p>Since the creation of the Jewish state in 1948, refugee resettlement outside its borders has always been a major strategic goal. <span class="article-link"><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-israel-s-nixed-plan-to-resettle-arabs-1.5301726">A 2013 article from the Israeli newspaper Haaretz</a></span> revealed secret archival documents showing that from the very beginning, Zionist Jews saw Europe as the destination of choice for the Arabs they had displaced.</p>
				<blockquote><p>In the first half of the 1960s, the Foreign Ministry continued to examine plans to encourage the emigration of Arab refugees from the Middle East to Europe, particularly to France and Germany. One option that was considered was to find them jobs in Germany, which was then in dire need of working hands. During 1962, Israeli officials examined the possibility of finding employment for Palestinian refugee laborers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The initial checks done for this plan, known as “Operation Worker,” and the correspondence involved, were kept completely under wraps.</p></blockquote>
				<p>This plan was eventually tabled since then Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meier feared it could generate a huge backlash from the German people. In the 1960s Israel was considerably less powerful and secure than it is today, so such bold plans had to be put on hold until later. But it demonstrates that foisting the Arabs on Europe as a form of racial revenge was on the minds of the Jews in Israel from the very beginning.</p>
				<p>Demographics have always been at the forefront of Israeli policy, and their control over Western governments has long been used to ensure that Jews remain a demographic majority on their newly seized territory. Meier leveraged Jewish power in Washington to scuttle a 1961 plan spearheaded by President Kennedy to offer resettlement in Israel to the then 1.1 million Palestinian refugees displaced by the 1948 war.</p>
				<blockquote><p>In late 1961, in the wake of President Kennedy’s initiative, Dr. Joseph Johnson, from the Carnegie Endowment, was appointed a special representative to tackle the problem and to work with the parties involved to come up with a solution. The plan he devised − to distribute questionnaires to the Palestinian refugees and permit those who wished to return to Israel, subject to security considerations − stirred deep fears in Jerusalem. Meir, who was appalled by the idea, wielded all the influence at her command in Washington in order to ensure that the plan met a quick death.</p></blockquote>
